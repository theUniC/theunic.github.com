## Introducing Octopress ##

Today I'm reopening my personal blog. And it comes with a big change. I've migrated from Wordpress to Octopress. Mainly for the content-orientation aspect of Octopress.
I'm very tired to fight against the so cool web interface of Wordpress for managing posts and all the stuff. I think Wordpress it's a great product besides the internal
crappy code, but I like the simplicity of Octopress & Jekyll.

## The pros ##

Mainly the reasons for the change have been

1. Octopress is dead simple. You don't need complicated and bloated web interfaces. Instead is a matter of write content. As simple as that.
2. It's fast than Wordpress. Remember Octopress is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), a static blog-aware web site generator, that dumps all of your posts to plain HTML.
3. Plays nice with Github. Jekyll is intended to be deployed to github pages, so to publish the blog had been matter of minutes.

## The cons ##

Must admit. Octopress / Jekyll it isn't the silver bullet.

1. It's hard to get started. I'm a ruby newby! :(
2. Don't use Octopress if your main concern it's not only to write content.
