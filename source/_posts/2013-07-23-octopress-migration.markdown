## Why I have migrated from Wordpress to Octopress ##

Mainly for the content-orientation aspect of Octopress. I'm very tired to fight against the so cool web interface of Wordpress
for managing post. I think Wordpress it's a great product besides the internal crappy code, but I like the simplicity of
Octopress / Jekyll and the fact the they are both focused on the content using Markdown to write new entries.

So, be welcome everyone to my new blog version powered by Octopress! :)
